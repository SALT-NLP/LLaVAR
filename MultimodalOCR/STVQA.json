        "answer": "If this product, which seems to be a cleaning solution or detergent, gets in your eyes, it can cause irritation and discomfort. The eyes are sensitive organs, and exposure to chemicals present in the product could lead to pain, itchiness, and potentially harm the cornea, conjunctiva, or other parts of the eye. It is crucial to handle such products with care and avoid contact with the eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent any adverse effects. In case of accidental exposure, it is advisable to rinse the affected eyes thoroughly with clean water and seek medical attention if irritation persists or worsens.",

It is evident that the car requires unleaded gasoline as its fuel source. Unleaded gasoline is a common type of fuel used in most vehicles, including cars and motorcycles. It is important to use the correct fuel type for your vehicle to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and to comply with any applicable fuel regulations in your region. Using the wrong fuel, such as leaded gas in a vehicle designed for unleaded gasoline, can cause damage to the engine and other components, and may lead to poor performance and increased emissions.",
